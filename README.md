# OpenDataHub

OpenDataHub is a cloud-based software platform for sharing publicly available scientific datasets. 

It serves two main groups of users. 
The dataset providers, which are the researchers responsible for sharing and maintaining datasets, and the dataset users, that are those who desire to access the public data. 

To the former are given tools to easily publish and maintain large volumes of data, whereas the later are given tools to enable the preview and creation of subsets of the original data through the introduction of filter and aggregation operations.
